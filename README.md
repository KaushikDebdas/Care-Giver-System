# Care-Giver-System
In Bangladesh, problem often occurs when a family member is the only earning member & can not look after their sick or older family member at home due to their job. 
To overcome this problem our system can reduce it by providing people to look after them.Increasing demand of paid caregivers and formal care in families and existing caregiving
system where family caregivers are burdened with too much pressure, workload and stress motivated us a lot to build an online based project which will provide a unique approach to solve problems of the existing care-giving system in our country. Some international organizations that provide training and support to family caregivers also help us to form
a complete structure of our project.
